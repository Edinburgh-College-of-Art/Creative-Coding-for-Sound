# Getting Started

This document will cover how to install the necessary software and libraries to getting started with your Arduino kit.

## Tutorial Videos

The following tutorial videos cover the setup material in the rest of this document. Follow along if you are having any difficulty setting up.

## Setup

Before you start programming your Arduino you will need to:

- [Download Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software#download): Download the relevant version for your operating system.
- [Install Arduino SAMD Core](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33IoT#use-your-arduino-nano-33-iot-on-the-arduino-desktop-ide): simply follow the instructions in the link


### [Upload Your First Sketch](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/NANO33IoT#use-your-arduino-nano-33-iot-with-the-arduino-iot-cloud#open-your-first-sketch)

Now you should be ready to upload your first program (sketch) to the Arduino. First, plug in your Arduino to your computer with the USB cable provided in your kit.

#### Open Blink Sketch

#### Upload the program

You should now have a blinking LED on your Arduino.

### Troubleshooting

If you have any problem with the above, it can help sometimes to restart your computer

### Basic Examples


#### Blink

Arduino & LED on breadboard (resistors?)

#### Analogue Read

Add potentiometer to breadboard (input data, make decision, make LED blink) – Fade

#### SerialRead


### Arduino Libraries

Libraries required to run the examples.

### WiFi Firmware Updates

Make sure your wifi module is the latest firmware. If you've downloaded Arduino IDE before, check your WifiNINA library and make sure it is at version `1.6.0`.

The firmware of your wifi would be `1.3.0`. Everyone should be starting at firmware `1.2.3` so you **will** need to update.
